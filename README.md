# AddressBook
Android app AddressBook that lets users create/save/edit Contacts and Contact info.
This is the AddressBook App from the Android 6 for Programmers book 3rd Edition by Deitel Developer Series. (C) Copyright 1992-2014 by Deitel & Associates, Inc. and Pearson Education, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

This app shows how to use FragmentTransactions, the Fragment Back Stack, SQLite, SQLiteDatabase, SQLiteOpenHelper,
ContentProvider, ContentResolver, Loader, LoaderManager, Cursor, and GUI Styles.

You will learn how to use FragmentTransaction and the back stack to dynamically attach Fragments to and detach Fragments from the GUI,
use a ReyclerView to display data from a database, create and open databases with SQLiteOpenHelper, use a ContentProvider and a
SQLiteDatabase object to interact with data in a SQLite database, use a ContentResolver to invoke methods of a ContentProvider to perform
tasks with a database, use a LoaderManager and Loaders to perform database access asynchronously outside the GUI thread, and use Cursors to
manipulate database query results.

I, myself, specifically commented on every line of code so that a beginner Android developer may clearly understand and learn from this application.
